This project has been done to demonstrate the skills and knowledge gained in **The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics portfolio**. Some fundamental topics such as the use of events, functions, DOM manipulation and more were applied here.

Also, I make use of my skills acquired outside the course, such as the creation of vectors or the use of fonts to be able to provide a better product for this project.

# Resources Information

- **Font used:**
1. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito">**Nunito**</a>: Main text, buttons, and title
2. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martian+Mono">Martian Mono</a>: Calculator Screen

- **Favicon and Main Title Logo**: Made by me!

Creating vectors and illustrations is a new skill I'm learning at the moment, and I'm loving it! So I found the opportunity to apply my knowledge of vector graphics in this project!
