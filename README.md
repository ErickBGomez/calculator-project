Calculate It! gives you the basics of a calculator, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integers and decimal numbers. And you can also make use of this project with the mouse or with the keyboard support as well.

This project has been done to demonstrate the skills and knowledge gained in **The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics portfolio**. Some fundamental topics such as the use of events, functions, DOM manipulation and more were applied here.

Also, I make use of my skills acquired outside the course, such as the creation of vectors or the use of fonts to be able to provide a better product for this project.

# Keyboard Support

As mentioned before. The project has keyboard support instead of clicking buttons.

## Keybindings:

- `0 to 9`: Enter its respective digit into the calculator memory.
- `.`: Enter the decimal point into the calculator.
- `+`: Select addition operator.
- `-`: Select subtraction operator.
- `*`: Select multiplication operator.
- `/`: Select division operator.
- `Enter`: Calculate entered operation.
- `Backspace`: Delete the last digit.
- `Escape`: Delete calculator memory.

All of these keys work on both the alphanumeric keypad and the numeric keypad as well.

1. **[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito)**: Main text, buttons, and title

Creating vectors and illustrations is a new skill I'm learning at the moment, and I'm loving it! So I found the opportunity to apply my knowledge of vector graphics in this project!
